== 8tracks Boombox Google Chrome Extension
 
An unofficial 8tracks http://www.8tracks.com Chrome extension to let you search and play 8tracks mixes within the extension itself or in new tabs.
 
== Installation
 
The extension can be installed in the standard way from 
https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/pmdfenjjbfliihnjlcpifgaaehankhnj
 
== Usage
 
Use the search box in the top right corner to search 8tracks. 

Unfortunately, mix playback inside the extension popup is limited by the fact that a Chrome extension popup closes as soon as you click away from it. So click on open mix "in a new tab" instead once you have chosen a mix and would like to listen to it in the background.
